        "Incorrect: A. Binary search takes more time on average than linear search. Because Binary Search eliminates half of the list in each step, it is more time efficient than Linear Search. While Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), linear search has a time complexity of O(n).\n",
        "#### Correct: B. Binary search cannot be used on unsorted lists without modifications. The list must be sorted in order for Binary Search to successfully eliminate half of the list. \n",
        "Incorrect: C. Binary search always returns the first occurrence of the target. Standard binary search simply returns any one occurrence, not specifically the first. Unless it's explicitly modified, it may return the middle or some other occurrence.\n",
        "Incorrect: D. Binary search can only be used on lists with unique values. Binary search works on lists with duplicate values, but theysometimes must be modified if searching for the first or last occurrence of a value. It does not require all elements to be unique.\n",
