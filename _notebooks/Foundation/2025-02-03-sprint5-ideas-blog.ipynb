    "### 4.1: The Internet\n",
    "- Computing Device: physical artifact that can run a program (computers, tablets, servers, routers, smart sensors)\n",
    "- Computing System: group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose\n",
    "- computer network: type of computing system\n",
    "- Routing: the process of finding a path from sender to reciever\n",
    "- Bandwith: maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time, usually measured in bits/second\n",
    "- Scalability of a system: Capacity for the system to change in size to meet new demands\n",
    "- Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for using the packet between the origin and the destination on the internet\n",
    "- IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2: Fault Tolerance\n",
    "- The internet is designed to be fault-tolerant with abstractions for routing and transmitting data\n",
    "- Redundancy: the inclusion of exrta components tha  can be used to mitigate failing system if other component fail\n",
    "- Having more than one path between any two connected devices can accomplish network redundancy\n",
    "- Redundancy of routing options between two points increases reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and people\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3: Parallel and Distributed Computing\n",
    "- Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion\n",
    "solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively\n",
    "- distributed computing allows large problems to be solved quicker\n",
    "- when increasing the use of parallel computing in a solutoin, the efficiency of the solution is still limited by the sequential portion\n",
