    "### Instructions for Input\n",
    "- **User Input:**\n",
    "  - The user provides input through an HTML form that collects their name, bio, top five favorite artists, and profile picture URL.\n",
    "  - This triggers the `handleFormSubmission` event when the user submits the form.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```html\n",
    "    <form id=\"profileForm\" onsubmit=\"handleFormSubmission(event); return false;\">\n",
    "        <label for=\"name\">Your Name:</label>\n",
    "        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required>\n",
    "    </form>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Use of a Collection Type\n",
    "- **List:**\n",
    "  - The `artists` input is stored as a comma-separated list and then converted into an array.\n",
    "  - Storing this data in a list makes it easier to manipulate and display users' favorite artists dynamically.\n",
    "  - The list simplifies the process of iterating over artists to display them later.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    const artists = document.getElementById('artists').value.split(',');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributing Procedure\n",
    "- **Procedure: `createProfile`**\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Handles sending user input to the backend API for profile creation.\n",
    "  - **Parameters:**\n",
    "    - `name` (string)\n",
    "    - `artists` (list)\n",
    "    - `bio` (string)\n",
    "    - `profilePicture` (string)\n",
    "  - **Return Type:** None (performs an API request and handles response asynchronously)\n",
    "  - **Implementation:**\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    const createProfile = async (name, artists, bio, profilePicture) => {\n",
    "        const url = `${pythonURI}/api/profile`;\n",
    "        const data = {\n",
    "            name: name,\n",
    "            uid: name,\n",
    "            pfp: profilePicture,\n",
    "            bio: bio,\n",
    "            favorite_artist: artists\n",
    "        };\n",
    "        try {\n",
    "            const response = await fetch(url, {\n",
    "                method: 'POST',\n",
    "                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n",
    "                body: JSON.stringify(data)\n",
    "            });\n",
    "            if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "                const errorData = await response.json();\n",
    "                console.error(\"Error:\", errorData.message);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        } catch (error) {\n",
    "            console.error(\"Network error:\", error);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    " **Sequencing:**\n",
    "    - The function `handleFormSubmission` is the first user-driven event. The `onsubmit` event is used to trigger the profile creation process when the user submits the form, ensuring that the input is correctly captured.\n",
    "    - The form is then validated using the `wordCount` and `bioError` checks. Before any data is processed or sent to the server, the bio field is validated to ensure that it contains between 1-25 words. This ensures that the form data is correct before proceeding. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. This process also demonstrates **iteration** as I make use of an if else statement to ensure that the bio does not exceed the 25 word limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "  const bio = document.getElementById('bio').value.trim();\n",
    "  const wordCount = bio.split(/\\s+/).filter(word => word).length;\n",
    "  if (wordCount < 1 || wordCount > 25) {\n",
    "    errorDiv.textContent = \"Bio must be between 1 and 25 words.\";\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "}    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The data from the form is then extracted into variables.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const name = document.getElementById('name').value;\n",
    "const artists = document.getElementById('artists').value;\n",
    "const profilePicture = document.getElementById('profilePicture').value;   \n",
    "```\n",
    "  - After the data is collected and validated, the `createProfile` function is called. This function sends the form data as a JSON object to the backend via a POST request to create the user profile.\n",
    "  - After profile creation, the script authenticates the user by sending the profile’s username (uid) and a password (here hardcoded as \"password\").\n",
    "  - Once the profile is successfully created, a button is dynamically added to the page to allow the user to navigate to their newly created profile page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling the Student-Developed Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `createProfile` function is called inside `handleFormSubmission` after validating the input:\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  async function runProcess() {\n",
    "      await createProfile(name, artists, bio, profilePicture);\n",
    "      showProfileLinkButton();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  runProcess();\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual Output:**\n",
    "  - A success message is displayed in an alert box when the profile is successfully created.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    alert(\"Profile created successfully!\");\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - A dynamically created button allows users to navigate to their newly created profile.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    function showProfileLinkButton() {\n",
    "        const button = document.createElement('button');\n",
    "        button.textContent = \"Go to Profile\";\n",
    "        button.addEventListener('click', function () {\n",
    "            window.location.href = \"{{ site.baseurl }}/melodymates/created_profile.html/\";\n",
    "        });\n",
