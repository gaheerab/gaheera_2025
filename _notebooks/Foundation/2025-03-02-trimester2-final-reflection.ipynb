    "<img alt=\"created upp\" src=\"/gaheera_2025/images/updated profile page.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "Originally, when a user clicked edit, the text boxes where they enter their bio and favorite artists were empty. I changed the fetchProfile function so that when it loads the profile data, it automatically fills in the bio and favorite artists in the text boxes. This makes it easier for users because they don’t have to type everything from scratch—they can simply edit their existing information. To make this change, I added the following lines of code to the fetchProfile function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "document.getElementById('editBio').value = result.bio;\n",
    "document.getElementById('editArtists').value = result.favorite_artist;\n",
    "``` \n",

    "### 2. CPT Requirements: Sequencing\n",
    "- Understanding sequencing: The order of the steps in an algorithm is crucial to ensure that the algorithm works as intended. Sequencing is the order in which code statements are executed. The following reflects on the order of code statements that allow the user profile to be created successfully.\n",
    "  - **Sequencing:**\n",
    "    - The function `handleFormSubmission` is the first user-driven event. The `onsubmit` event is used to trigger the profile creation process when the user submits the form, ensuring that the input is correctly captured.\n",
    "    - The form is then validated using the `wordCount` and `bioError` checks. Before any data is processed or sent to the server, the bio field is validated to ensure that it contains between 1-25 words. This ensures that the form data is correct before proceeding. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. This process also demonstrates **iteration** as I make use of an if else statement to ensure that the bio does not exceed the 25 word limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "  const bio = document.getElementById('bio').value.trim();\n",
    "  const wordCount = bio.split(/\\s+/).filter(word => word).length;\n",
    "  if (wordCount < 1 || wordCount > 25) {\n",
    "    errorDiv.textContent = \"Bio must be between 1 and 25 words.\";\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "}    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The data from the form is then extracted into variables.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const name = document.getElementById('name').value;\n",
    "const artists = document.getElementById('artists').value;\n",
    "const profilePicture = document.getElementById('profilePicture').value;   \n",
    "```\n",
    "  - After the data is collected and validated, the `createProfile` function is called. This function sends the form data as a JSON object to the backend via a POST request to create the user profile.\n",
    "  - After profile creation, the script authenticates the user by sending the profile’s username (uid) and a password (here hardcoded as \"password\").\n",
    "  - Once the profile is successfully created, a button is dynamically added to the page to allow the user to navigate to their newly created profile page."

    "## My Big 5 Accomplishments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. API Creation and Setup with Static Data\n",
    "- Developed an API using Flask to manage user profiles.\n",
    "- Implemented an endpoint to create and store profile data.\n",
    "- Utilized SQLite for initial data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ProfileAPI:\n",
    "    class _CRUD(Resource):\n",
    "        def post(self):\n",
    "            body = request.get_json()\n",
    "            name = body.get('name')\n",
    "            uid = body.get('uid')\n",
    "            profile_obj = PublicProfile(\n",
    "                name=name,\n",
    "                uid=uid,\n",
    "                pfp=body.get('pfp', ''),\n",
    "                bio=body.get('bio', ''),\n",
    "                favorite_artist=body.get('favorite_artist', '')\n",
    "            )\n",
    "            profile = profile_obj.create()\n",
    "            return jsonify(profile.read())\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function ensures profiles are created with a name, unique user ID, and optional attributes like profile picture and favorite artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Backend Dynamic Data\n",
    "- Integrated Flask-RESTful API to process dynamic user data.\n",
    "- Implemented CORS to allow secure cross-origin requests.\n",
    "- Established a RESTful service that supports user authentication and authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CORS(app, supports_credentials=True, origins='*')  \n",
    "api = Api(profile_api)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This setup enables the API to dynamically handle requests from different origins, ensuring seamless interaction with the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Backend to Frontend Integration via HTTP Requests\n",
    "- Connected the frontend and backend using HTTP requests.\n",
    "- Implemented `fetch` API to retrieve and update user profiles dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function fetchProfile() {\n",
    "    fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/profileId`, requestOptions)\n",
    "        .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "        .then(result => {\n",
    "            document.getElementById('name').textContent = result.name;\n",
    "            document.getElementById('bio').textContent = result.bio;\n",
    "            document.getElementById('favoriteArtists').textContent = result.favorite_artist;\n",
    "        })\n",
    "        .catch(error => console.error(\"Error fetching profile:\", error));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function retrieves and updates the user profile dynamically on the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Edit Post and Delete Features using CRUD Methods\n",
    "- Implemented profile editing via `PUT` requests.\n",
    "- Enabled profile deletion using `DELETE` requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "window.editProfile = function() {\n",
    "    const updatedProfile = {\n",
    "        uid: uid,\n",
    "        bio: document.getElementById('editBio').value,\n",
    "        favorite_artist: document.getElementById('editArtists').value\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/profile`, {\n",
    "        method: \"PUT\",\n",
    "        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n",
    "        body: JSON.stringify(updatedProfile)\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .then(response => response.text())\n",
    "    .then(() => alert(\"Profile updated successfully!\"))\n",
    "    .catch(error => console.error(\"Error updating profile:\", error));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function allows users to modify their profile details and update them in the backend database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Deployment\n",
    "- Configured Flask app to be hosted on a live server.\n",
    "- Ensured seamless API deployment with CORS and authentication settings.\n",
    "- Integrated frontend components for smooth user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensured a fully functional profile management feature on Melody Mates, enhancing user engagement and personalization.\n",

    "## CPT Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions for Input\n",
    "- **User Input:**\n",
    "  - The user provides input through an HTML form that collects their name, bio, top five favorite artists, and profile picture URL.\n",
    "  - This triggers the `handleFormSubmission` event when the user submits the form.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```html\n",
    "    <form id=\"profileForm\" onsubmit=\"handleFormSubmission(event); return false;\">\n",
    "        <label for=\"name\">Your Name:</label>\n",
    "        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required>\n",
    "    </form>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Use of a Collection Type\n",
    "- **List:**\n",
    "  - The `artists` input is stored as a comma-separated list and then converted into an array.\n",
    "  - Storing this data in a list makes it easier to manipulate and display users' favorite artists dynamically.\n",
    "  - The list simplifies the process of iterating over artists to display them later.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    const artists = document.getElementById('artists').value.split(',');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributing Procedure\n",
    "- **Procedure: `createProfile`**\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Handles sending user input to the backend API for profile creation.\n",
    "  - **Parameters:**\n",
    "    - `name` (string)\n",
    "    - `artists` (list)\n",
    "    - `bio` (string)\n",
    "    - `profilePicture` (string)\n",
    "  - **Return Type:** None (performs an API request and handles response asynchronously)\n",
    "  - **Implementation:**\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    const createProfile = async (name, artists, bio, profilePicture) => {\n",
    "        const url = `${pythonURI}/api/profile`;\n",
    "        const data = {\n",
    "            name: name,\n",
    "            uid: name,\n",
    "            pfp: profilePicture,\n",
    "            bio: bio,\n",
    "            favorite_artist: artists\n",
    "        };\n",
    "        try {\n",
    "            const response = await fetch(url, {\n",
    "                method: 'POST',\n",
    "                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n",
    "                body: JSON.stringify(data)\n",
    "            });\n",
    "            if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "                const errorData = await response.json();\n",
    "                console.error(\"Error:\", errorData.message);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        } catch (error) {\n",
    "            console.error(\"Network error:\", error);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequencing:**\n",
    "  - The function `createProfile` first constructs the data object, then sends it to the backend using a `fetch` request.\n",
    "- **Selection:**\n",
    "  - The program checks if the `response.ok` condition is met before proceeding.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "        const errorData = await response.json();\n",
    "        console.error(\"Error:\", errorData.message);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Iteration:**\n",
    "  - Iterates over the words in the bio to count them and validate length constraints (1–25 words).\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    const wordCount = bio.split(/\\s+/).filter(word => word).length;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling the Student-Developed Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `createProfile` function is called inside `handleFormSubmission` after validating the input:\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  async function runProcess() {\n",
    "      await createProfile(name, artists, bio, profilePicture);\n",
    "      showProfileLinkButton();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  runProcess();\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual Output:**\n",
    "  - A success message is displayed in an alert box when the profile is successfully created.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    alert(\"Profile created successfully!\");\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - A dynamically created button allows users to navigate to their newly created profile.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    function showProfileLinkButton() {\n",
    "        const button = document.createElement('button');\n",
    "        button.textContent = \"Go to Profile\";\n",
    "        button.addEventListener('click', function () {\n",
    "            window.location.href = \"{{ site.baseurl }}/melodymates/created_profile.html/\";\n",
    "        });\n",
