        "Our Pilot City project features an engaging and educational game designed to deepen users’ understanding of DNA structure through interactive play. The core of the game revolves around correctly pairing nucleotide bases (A with T, C with G) in an intuitive, hands-on interface. As users interact with the animated DNA strand, they visually experience the process of DNA \"unzipping,\" mimicking how it naturally separates during replication.\n",

        "To reinforce learning and keep users motivated, the game introduces a dynamic life system: players lose lives for incorrect base pairings, but can earn them back by answering fun, DNA-themed trivia questions. These questions not only serve as a second-chance mechanism but also reinforce scientific concepts in a memorable, gamified format.\n",
