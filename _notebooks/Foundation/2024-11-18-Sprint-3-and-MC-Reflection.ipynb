    "## Sprint 3 Contributions\n",
    "- Overview: My group decided to make a site involving music artists and genres. Because our class's overarching theme was debates, we created a chatroom that allowed users to engage in friendly debates about their favorite artists, depending on their favorite genres.\n",
    "- Collaboration Evidence: Because it was my first time creating a backend program, I asked CSA friends to assist me through the proccess and learned about the Python flask framework with SQLlite. I also got to work with API structures for first time and learned how I needed to format requests. I saw how the API and the model interacted, seeing each posted comment appear in our backend. I also had the additional role of Scrummaster, ensuring our frontend was on track and integrated with backend. I managed my teams communication with other teams and led my team to find a site topic that fit with both our periods theme of voting and our own interests. We thought a chatroom in which people can debate their favorite music artists would foster engaging and friendly conversations that would challenge us as students while also being able to enjoy the proccess.\n",
    "- Program Function: Users can comment, like one anothers comments, and title their comments so that readers can understand their main argument without reading their whole post.\n",
    "- The feedback we reieved at N@TM was mainly positive. However, we were told that our like button did not function, which we worked toether to fix. We realized the issue was in the program to increase the like count on every click, which we adjusted to create a properly functioning button."

    "- What I learned from this quiz: From this quiz, I learned new terms like citizens science and redundnat routing. I also learned how to analyze the output of a prgoram to determine what code should replace missing segments in the input code.\n",

    "    - I feel I was weakest on questions that require analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and the policies of computing, as well as internet procedures. This reflected my unfamiliarity with technical foundations. \n",
