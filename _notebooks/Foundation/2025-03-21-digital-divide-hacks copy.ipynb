    "One important way to fix the digital dicide it to expand technology distribution programs. This would involve schools, libraries, and nonprofits to provide free or low-cost computers, tablets, and mobile devices to students and low-income families. For example, Google’s Chromebook Distribution Program provides schools with laptops to close the technology gap. Other steps that we can take to reduce this divide is encourage more tech donations and promote tech education in school by integrating code, digital skills, and cybersecurity in schools. \n"
